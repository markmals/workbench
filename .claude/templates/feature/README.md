# Feature Template

This directory holds the **canonical templates** for a new feature. When starting a feature, copy the structure here into `features/<NNNN>-<slug>/` and replace the placeholders.

## Layout

```
.claude/templates/feature/
├── README.md                         ← this file
├── NARRATIVE.md                      ← single file per feature
├── stories/STORY.md                  ← copy + rename per story
├── use-cases/USE_CASE.md             ← copy + rename per use case
├── user-flow/USER_FLOW.md            ← copy + rename per flow
├── models/MODEL.md                   ← copy + rename per model
├── view-models/VIEW_MODEL.md         ← copy + rename per view model
└── errors/ERROR.md                   ← copy + rename per error
```

## How to use

1. Pick the next number: `features/<NNNN>-<slug>/`. Slug is kebab-case.
2. Copy this directory's structure into the new feature directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p features/<NNNN>-<slug>/{stories,use-cases,user-flow,models,view-models,errors}
    cp .claude/templates/feature/NARRATIVE.md features/<NNNN>-<slug>/NARRATIVE.md
    ```
3. Replace placeholders in the copied files:
    - `<feature-slug>` — the kebab-case slug (e.g. `managing-items`)
    - `<id>` — a stable dotted ID (e.g. `story.item.create`)
    - Section content
4. For each new spec instance (story, model, etc.), copy the appropriate `<KIND>.md` template into the matching subdirectory and rename to `<id>.md` (using dots in the filename: `story.item.create.md`).
5. See `specs/CONVENTIONS.md` for ID rules.

## What about specs?

There is no separate spec template directory for cross-cutting specs because most cross-cutting specs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) are singletons that already exist. For promoted models or other items, copy the relevant feature template (e.g. `models/MODEL.md`) into `specs/models/<id>.md` and update the frontmatter.
