# /sdd-defect $ARGUMENTS

You are filing a sub-spec defect observation. First token of `$ARGUMENTS` is the platform (`web`, `ios`, `android`, `convex`); the rest is a free-text description of what was observed.

## Intent

Capture an observation while it's fresh, in the structured shape from `.claude/templates/platform/DEFECTS.md`, then return control to the user so they don't lose their current train of thought. This is the **intake** command. Resolution happens later via the `triaging-defects` skill — not now.

Sub-spec defects are platform-local, observed cosmetic / polish / quirk issues that the cross-platform spec deliberately doesn't cover. See `specs/CONVENTIONS.md` → "What is NOT a spec" for the boundary.

## Steps

1. **Resolve the target file.**
    - `web`, `ios`, `android` → `apps/<platform>/DEFECTS.md`
    - `convex` → `services/convex/DEFECTS.md`
    - If the file doesn't exist yet, copy `.claude/templates/platform/DEFECTS.md` to the target path and replace `<platform>` placeholders in the heading and example paths with the real platform name.
2. **Gather the entry fields.** Use `AskUserQuestion` only when the slash command argument didn't already supply the answer. The fields are:
    - **title** — short imperative (e.g. "Clip avoidance broken on iPhone SE")
    - **where** — file path or screen
    - **symptom** — one sentence: what the user sees
    - **repro** — minimal steps to reproduce
    
    Do **not** ask for severity, priority, owner, or status — they don't exist in this system. If the user's argument already contains enough detail to infer a field, infer it; don't re-ask.
3. **Offer a screenshot, but don't insist.** If the defect is visual, ask once whether to capture one. If yes, drive the platform via its verification skill (`web-verification`, `ios-simulator-control`, `android-emulator-control`), save the file to `apps/<platform>/.defects/<slug>.png` (slug derived from the title), and reference the path from the entry. If the user declines or is mid-flow, skip — they invoked this command to capture quickly, not to context-switch.
4. **Append the entry under `## Open`.** Use this shape exactly (omit screenshot/notes lines if empty):

    ```markdown
    ### <title>
    - observed: <YYYY-MM-DD>
    - where: <where>
    - symptom: <symptom>
    - repro: <repro>
    - screenshot: <optional path>
    - notes: <optional>
    ```

    If the file still contains the `_(empty)_` placeholder under `## Open`, replace it with the new entry. Otherwise append after the last existing entry.
5. **Confirm in one line and stop.** Output a single short line:

    ```
    Filed: <title> in apps/<platform>/DEFECTS.md
    ```

    Do **not** start triaging. Do **not** offer to fix. Do **not** open the relevant code. The user invoked this command to capture without derailing; respect that.

## Constraints

- **Don't propose fixes.** Triage is a separate, deliberate act — the `triaging-defects` skill handles it.
- **Don't invoke `systematic-debugging`.** Filing is not investigating.
- **Don't open the implementation file** referenced by `where`. The point is capture, not exploration.
- **One entry per invocation.** If the user describes multiple defects, file the first and tell them to re-invoke for the others. Bundling defeats the structured-intake purpose.

## Commit

Filing a defect is a small, durable change that should land in git immediately — the entry is the contract until triaged, and leaving it in the working tree across other work risks it getting bundled into an unrelated commit.

Commit as soon as the entry is appended:

```
chore: file defect <title> on <platform>
```

If a screenshot was captured, include it in the same commit. Stage explicitly by path — never `git add .` — per `.claude/rules/commit-discipline.md`.

## Implementation status

The slash command is scaffolded; the agent fulfills it manually using `Edit`, `Write`, `AskUserQuestion`, and (optionally) the per-platform verification skill for screenshots. No additional tooling required.
