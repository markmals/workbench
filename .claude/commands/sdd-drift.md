# /sdd-drift $ARGUMENTS

You are detecting drift on a single platform: `$ARGUMENTS` (one of `web`, `ios`, `android`, `convex`).

## Intent

Identify specs and implementations that are out of sync. Drift takes several forms:

1. **Spec changed after impl was last touched.** The spec's `mtime` is newer than the most recent `mtime` of any file referencing it. Likely the impl needs updating.
2. **Impl changed without spec update.** The impl files referencing a spec have all been touched after the spec, _and_ their behavior may have changed. Likely the spec needs updating (use `/sdd-reconcile`).
3. **Orphaned impl.** A file references a spec ID that no longer exists.
4. **Unimplemented spec.** A spec exists with no reverse pointer on this platform (and is not marked optional for this platform).
5. **Untagged impl.** A file in the platform's source tree has no `// SPEC:` annotation and is not in the platform's allowlist of "manual" code.

## Steps

1. **Walk all spec files** under `specs/` and `features/`. Build a map of `id → {file_path, mtime, applies_to_platforms}`.
2. **Walk the target platform's source tree.** For each source file:
    - If it has `// SPEC: <id>`, record the pair.
    - If it has `// SPEC: manual`, ignore it.
    - If it has neither, flag as untagged (case 5).
3. **Compute drift cases 1–4** from the cross-product of the two walks.
4. **Emit a report** grouped by drift type, with the relevant file paths and IDs.

## Output format

```
DRIFT REPORT — platform: <platform>
====================================

[1] Spec changed after impl (N)
  - <spec-id>  spec mtime: <ts>  newest impl mtime: <ts>
    <impl files>
  ...

[2] Impl changed without spec update (N)
  ...

[3] Orphaned impl (N)
  ...

[4] Unimplemented spec (N)
  ...

[5] Untagged impl files (N)
  ...
```

## Implementation status

Manual reasoning until tooling lands. A simple `rg` + `find -newer` combo suffices for cases 1–3; for cases 4–5, walk both trees and diff.
