# Rust CLI Development

This skill covers **how to write the CLI when its stack is Rust**. The CLI is one platform with a
choice of stack — Node, Rust, or Go — picked at `/setup`; this is the **Rust** stack, and it lives
at `apps/cli/`. For the _workflow_ of implementing a spec, see `implementing-a-spec`. For _what to
build_, see the spec.

The web app is the **reference implementation**. This is a **terminal client** — it mirrors web
behavior idiomatically in a TUI. Read the web realization for context; the spec is authoritative.

The TUI layer is **[charmed_rust](https://github.com/dicklesworthstone/charmed_rust)** — a Rust port
of the Charm ecosystem (bubbletea · bubbles · lipgloss · huh · glamour · harmonica · wish), chosen
so this stack stays at parity with the Go CLI stack. It needs **Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024)**.

The Go CLI stack mirrors this exactly with the original Charm libraries — see `go-cli-development`.

## The Client layer depends on the backend mode

How the CLI reaches its data is set by the project's backend (see `specs/ARCHITECTURE.md` →
"Backend modes"):

- **OpenAPI** — a typed client generated by Progenitor over **reqwest**; never assemble requests by hand.
- **Convex** — Convex's Rust client.
- **No API** — no client at all; **Diesel/SQLite** is the source of truth.

In the remote modes, **Diesel/SQLite** is a local-first cache (not a second backend) and identity
flows through **Clerk**, whose token the client attaches. See `apps/cli/CLAUDE.md` for the wrapper
that exposes idiomatic call sites.

## Idioms (read these before writing code)

### Clap derive for the CLI surface

Define commands and args declaratively with `#[derive(Parser)]`. Keep parsing thin — parse into a
struct, then hand off. No business logic in the arg layer.

```rust
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "app")]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Command,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Command {
    /// List items
    List,
    /// Create an item
    Create { title: String },
}
```

### charmed_rust bubbletea: pure state + event loop, separate from rendering

Hold UI state in an **app-state model**. An `update` step folds a message into new state; a `view`
step renders a string from that state via `lipgloss`/`bubbles`. The **update layer is pure and
testable** — no IO, no terminal handles. This pure layer is the view-model analog and the **primary
spec target**. `bubbletea` (charmed_rust's Elm/TEA-style runtime) supplies the model · message ·
update · view loop — you write the model and the pure `update`; the runtime owns the event pump and
redraw scheduling.

```rust
// SPEC: vm.items.list
pub struct ItemsListModel {
    pub items: Vec<Item>,
    pub selected: usize,
}

pub enum Msg {
    Up,
    Down,
}

impl ItemsListModel {
    pub fn update(&mut self, msg: Msg) {
        match msg {
            Msg::Up => self.selected = self.selected.saturating_sub(1),
            Msg::Down => {
                if self.selected + 1 < self.items.len() {
                    self.selected += 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- The reverse pointer lives on the **model** (the pure update layer), not the view code.
- `view` reads state and renders with `lipgloss`/`bubbles`; it holds no logic. Tag it
  `// SPEC: manual` — it has no cross-platform contract.
- IO (reqwest calls, Diesel reads, terminal events) lives at the edges and feeds messages into `update`.

### Tests at the logic layer

Follow the Rust convention: a `#[cfg(test)] mod` carrying `// SPEC: <id>`, with a
`// [scenario.<id>]` comment above each `#[test]` fn (Rust test names can't hold dots or brackets,
so the scenario sub-ID lives in the comment that drift tooling greps).

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // SPEC: vm.items.list
    use super::*;

    // [scenario.items.list.move-down]
    #[test]
    fn moving_down_advances_selection() {
        let mut model = ItemsListModel {
            items: vec![Item::default(), Item::default()],
            selected: 0,
        };
        model.update(Msg::Down);
        assert_eq!(model.selected, 1);
    }
}
```

The pure `update` carries the behavioral coverage. When you need to pin the rendered frame, snapshot
the `view` string with `insta` — no real terminal required.

```rust
// [scenario.items.list.renders-title]
#[test]
fn renders_selected_title() {
    let model = ItemsListModel { items: vec![item("First item")], selected: 0 };
    insta::assert_snapshot!(model.view());
}
```

### Error handling with `Result`

Return `Result` from anything fallible. Use `thiserror` for library-style typed errors at the domain
boundary; `anyhow` for the application top level where you just want context and a clean exit. **No
`unwrap()` or `expect()` on fallible IO in shipped paths** — propagate with `?` and surface failures,
don't swallow them. `unwrap()` is fine only on invariants that genuinely can't fail (and a
`// SAFETY`-style comment helps the next reader).

## File layout (within apps/cli/)

See `apps/cli/CLAUDE.md` for the canonical layout. Summary:

```
apps/cli/src/
├── main.rs            ← entry point; wires Clap → app → bubbletea runtime
├── cli.rs             ← Clap parser definitions (thin)
├── app/               ← models + pure update logic (the spec target)
├── ui/                ← bubbletea views: lipgloss styling + bubbles widgets (dumb; SPEC: manual)
├── api/               ← Progenitor client wrapper (reqwest transport)
└── db/                ← Diesel schema, models, local-first cache
```

## Verifying

- `mise run -C apps/cli run` (or `cargo run`) for manual checks against a live terminal.
- `cargo test` for the pure logic layer — this is where behavioral coverage lives.
- `insta` snapshots to pin a rendered `view` string inside tests.
- `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt --check` must be clean before you declare done.

Run the verifying command **in this turn** and read its output before claiming success — see
`verification-before-completion`.

## When to invoke a more specific skill

- About to write tests? → `test-driven-development`
- About to claim work is done? → `verification-before-completion`
- Debugging something unexpected? → `systematic-debugging`
- Implementing a spec end-to-end? → `implementing-a-spec`

Related: `linux-development` shares this Rust/Diesel/reqwest/Progenitor toolchain (it ships a GTK GUI
instead of a TUI). The other two CLI stacks at `apps/cli` are `go-cli-development` (the same Charm
TUI in Go) and `server-cli-development` (Node; owns the OpenAPI contract in OpenAPI mode).

## Commit

Land focused, atomic commits as the work hits natural boundaries — typically per spec ID, per model +
its tests, or per cohesive refactor. See `.claude/rules/commit-discipline.md`.

Rust-specific notes:

- **`Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` bumps go alone.** A dependency change is its own commit
  (`chore: bump <crate>`); don't bundle it with feature code.
- **Generated Progenitor output rides with the contract/codegen commit** that produced it — never
  commit it out of sync with the OpenAPI document.
- **Don't commit build outputs.** `apps/cli/target/` is gitignored.
