# Triaging Defects

Work through entries in a platform's `DEFECTS.md` one at a time. For each entry, classify, resolve, and delete. The file should want to be empty by the time you stop.

The point of this skill is the drain. Without disciplined triage, `DEFECTS.md` becomes a TODO graveyard — a pile that grows faster than it shrinks, signalling "we have problems" without ever resolving them. Triage is what keeps the convention honest.

## When to use

- `DEFECTS.md` for a platform is non-empty and you're in a polish or fix pass on that platform.
- The user explicitly asks to triage defects, drain the file, or work through `DEFECTS.md`.
- A non-empty defect file has been sitting for long enough that the entries are stale — better to triage now than let the file calcify.

**Do NOT use this skill for:**

- Filing a new entry — that's `/sdd-defect`. This skill empties the file; the slash command fills it.
- Cross-platform behavioral drift — that's `/sdd-drift` and `/sdd-reconcile`. If the defect is "spec says X but platform does Y," it doesn't belong in `DEFECTS.md` in the first place; surface that to the user and reclassify.
- Spec gaps — that's `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` during authoring or a spec amendment afterward. If you're triaging and realize the entry is actually a spec gap, that's the `promote-to-spec` path below.

## The classifier — three buckets

For each entry, classify into exactly one of:

### 1. Fix in place

The defect is genuinely sub-spec: cosmetic, polish, platform quirk. Another platform could realize the same spec correctly without exhibiting this defect; the spec deliberately doesn't speak to it.

Resolution:

1. Reproduce.
2. Fix locally on this platform.
3. Verify the fix using the platform's verification skill.
4. Delete the entry and any orphaned screenshot under `apps/<platform>/.defects/`.
5. Commit per `.claude/rules/commit-discipline.md` — `fix: <short description>`. The commit message body briefly notes the defect that prompted the fix; that's the durable record.

### 2. Promote to spec

While reproducing, you realize the spec actually _should_ speak to this. There's a missing scenario, an unspecified state, an unhandled error, a behavioral contract that needs to exist across platforms.

Stop the fix. The "fix in place" path is wrong here, because every platform would be wrong without this behavior; that's a spec change, not a platform defect.

Resolution:

1. Identify the spec(s) that should grow to cover the case: a missing scenario in the relevant `story.*`, a new entry under `errors/`, a new transition or state in the relevant `vm.*`, etc.
2. Draft the amendment. Add Gherkin scenarios with stable sub-IDs per `specs/CONVENTIONS.md`.
3. Surface to the user for approval before the spec edit lands — promotion is a deliberate act.
4. Once approved, commit the spec change (`spec: ...`).
5. Run `/sdd-apply <spec-id> <platform>` for each affected platform (start with the platform that observed the defect). This is where the actual fix happens, mediated by the spec.
6. Delete the original `DEFECTS.md` entry — the spec change plus the implementation commits across platforms are the record.

### 3. Won't fix by design

The defect is real but acceptable. A platform idiom the spec deliberately leaves alone, a known limitation, a trade-off the user is comfortable with.

Resolution:

1. State the rationale clearly: why is this acceptable?
2. Delete the entry.
3. Note the rationale _briefly_ in the deletion commit message — one sentence under `chore: drop <title> from <platform> defects`.
4. Do **not** add a "won't fix" section to `DEFECTS.md`. The commit is the record. Re-adding the entry later (if it turns out to matter) is cheaper than letting the file grow a graveyard column.

If you find yourself classifying the same kind of defect as "won't fix" repeatedly, that's a signal — the design system or relevant spec should explicitly acknowledge the trade-off. Surface that pattern to the user.

## Process per entry

1. **Read the entry.** Read it fully. If repro steps are unclear, ask the user — don't guess at intent.
2. **Reproduce.** For non-trivial defects, invoke `systematic-debugging` and follow the four-phase discipline. For visual issues, drive the platform with its verification skill (`web-verification`, `ios-simulator-control`, `android-emulator-control`) and observe the behavior firsthand.
3. **Classify.** State the bucket and the reasoning before acting. Apply the promotion test (below) explicitly — don't classify "fix in place" by default just because that's the fastest path.
4. **Execute** the resolution for that bucket.
5. **Delete** the entry from `DEFECTS.md`. Also delete any screenshot under `apps/<platform>/.defects/` that the entry referenced — orphaned screenshots are noise.
6. **Commit** per `.claude/rules/commit-discipline.md`. One defect, one fix, one commit. Don't bundle multiple unrelated entries into one commit just because they came from the same file.

## The promotion test

Before classifying as "fix in place," explicitly ask:

> Would another platform realize this differently and still be correct?

If yes — the spec is silent and each platform's idiom can produce a different correct shape — fix in place is right.

If no — every platform must avoid this behavior to be correct — it belongs in the spec, not in `DEFECTS.md`. This is the same test `specs/CONVENTIONS.md` uses to decide what is and isn't a spec.

This test is the most important step in the skill. Skipping it produces a `DEFECTS.md` full of entries that are quietly cross-platform contracts, and a spec that doesn't say so.

## The drain principle

Entries should leave `DEFECTS.md` faster than they enter. The file is a drain, not a tracker.

If you notice the file growing — more entries arriving than leaving across multiple sessions — surface the pattern to the user. Two possibilities:

- The agent (or user) isn't triaging regularly enough. Schedule a drain pass.
- What's landing in the file should be specs instead. Bucket-by-bucket, are you mostly promoting? That's a sign the spec is under-specified for this domain and the intake category is wrong.

Either way, name the pattern. Don't quietly accept growth.

## Screenshots and `.defects/`

Defect entries can reference screenshots under `apps/<platform>/.defects/`. These are committed to the repo (not gitignored) so:

- They survive across machines and sessions.
- They show up in PRs and reviews when an entry lands.
- They're self-contained: a fresh checkout has both the entry and the picture.

The trade-off is that screenshots add bytes to the repo. They're typically small (a few hundred KB at most), and the triage discipline deletes them with their entries — so the directory should stay small. If a platform's `.defects/` directory is bloating, that's another signal the file isn't draining.

When you delete an entry, also delete any screenshot path it referenced. Run `ls apps/<platform>/.defects/` after triage to check for orphans.

## Anti-patterns

- **"Closed" markers.** Don't accumulate fixed entries with a "closed" annotation. Delete them. The commit is the record.
- **Severity, priority, assignee.** Don't add these fields. If you find yourself wanting them, you're rebuilding Jira.
- **Batched fixes.** Don't bundle unrelated entries into one commit just because they share `DEFECTS.md`. One defect, one fix, one commit — per `.claude/rules/commit-discipline.md`.
- **Speculative entries.** If you can't reproduce, you can't classify. Ask the user for clearer repro before triaging.
- **Skipping the promotion test.** "Just fix it locally" is the wrong default. The test is short; run it.
