description: Use when an implementation has passed spec-compliance and code-quality review and you need a final refutational pass before declaring a spec done — or whenever code looks correct and the suite is green but nobody has tried to break it. Surfaces defects on edges the spec never enumerated, tests that would still pass if the behavior were wrong, and aliasing / mutation / concurrency / resource bugs that confirmatory review approves.

# Adversarial Review

The first two reviews in `implementing-a-spec` are **confirmatory** — they check the code against the spec's explicit clauses and against the quality rules. This one is **refutational**. Its job is not to confirm the code is right; it is to assume the code is wrong and find the input, caller action, or missing test that proves it.

**Core principle:** a green suite and a clause-by-clause match prove the code does what someone thought to check. The adversary's whole value is in what nobody thought to check.

Lifts the adversarial-refinement idea from VDD. Adapted to this repo: a third review stage, fresh context, refute-by-default, convergence by exhaustion.

## When to use

- The final stage of `implementing-a-spec`, after spec-compliance ✅ and code-quality ✅.
- Before declaring any spec done on any platform.
- Any time code "looks correct, tests pass" but no one has tried to break it.
- Standalone, against an existing implementation you distrust.

**Do NOT use this skill for:**

- Replacing the two confirmatory reviews. This runs _after_ them, not instead of them. A refutational pass on code that doesn't even match the spec wastes the adversary's attention on the wrong layer.
- Trivial edits (a renamed constant, a typo). Nothing to break.

## Why a third stage at all

Measured baseline (this repo): a confirmatory reviewer handed an otherwise-correct view model whose only flaw was returning its internal mutable array by reference **approved it as "the implementation is correct"** — the spec never enumerated copy semantics, so the clause check sailed past the aliasing bug. It then **invented a test defect that did not exist**. Confirmatory review is good at enumerated gaps and blind to un-enumerated ones. That blind spot is this skill's entire reason to exist.

## The stance

**Refute by default.** Open assuming the code is broken and the tests are theater. Your output is the evidence that breaks it, or — only after you have genuinely tried and failed — the admission that you couldn't.

- No "overall this looks solid, but…". No preamble, no goodwill, no credit for clean formatting.
- Every finding is a concrete defect: the exact location, the exact input or caller action that triggers it, and the observed-vs-required behavior.
- You are not here to be agreeable. You are here to be correct about what is wrong.

## Fresh context, different model

- **Fresh context window.** The adversary must carry no memory of building the code. No accumulated goodwill, no "I know what I meant here."
- **Different model from the implementer where possible.** Cognitive diversity catches shared blind spots. If the implementer ran on Sonnet, run the adversary on Opus. A different model family is better still when one is available.

## What to attack

Five lenses. Spend the most effort on the first — it is the one confirmatory review cannot cover.

1. **Un-enumerated edges.** The spec lists what must hold. You hunt what it forgot to forbid. For every input: null, empty, whitespace-only, maximum size, negative, zero, duplicate, unicode, already-sorted, reverse-sorted, concurrent. For every return value: is it an alias of internal state a caller can mutate? For every resource: is it released on every path, including the throwing one? For every `async`: what races?
2. **Test quality.** Would this test still pass if the behavior were subtly wrong? Look for tautologies, assertions on implementation detail instead of observed behavior, over-mocking that tests the mock, fixtures that dodge the hard case, and **the missing test** — the scenario the spec implies but the suite never exercises.
3. **Spec fidelity under interpretation.** The code may satisfy the letter of a clause while violating its intent. Name the ambiguity and the interpretation the code chose.
4. **Security surface.** Unvalidated boundary input, injection vectors, authorization assumed rather than checked.
5. **Spec gaps the implementation reveals.** Implemented behavior that no spec clause covers — either scope creep to cut, or a real behavior the spec should capture. Route the latter back to the spec, not into silent acceptance.

## Verify before you report — no fabricated flaws

A fabricated defect corrupts the review as surely as a missed one. The baseline adversary that invented a nonexistent test bug failed exactly here.

**Every claimed defect carries a concrete reproduction you actually traced.** Before you write "this breaks on input X," run input X through the code in your head, step by step, and confirm the bad result. If you cannot produce the triggering input, you do not have a defect — you have a suspicion. Mark suspicions as suspicions; never promote them to findings.

## Convergence — the stopping signal

This is hallucination-based termination. You are done when, and only when, you are **reduced to inventing problems that aren't there.**

- Real defect found → report it, it feeds back, you go again on the fixed code.
- Findings have decayed to wording nitpicks and stylistic preference → converged. Say so plainly.
- You catch yourself manufacturing a flaw to have something to say → that is the exit signal, not a finding. Stop and report convergence.

Do not pad. "I tried to break it along all five lenses and could not" is a clean, valuable output. An invented flaw is a corrupted one.

## Output format

```
ADVERSARIAL REVIEW — <spec-id> on <platform>

DEFECTS (must fix):
  1. <location> — <what's wrong> — repro: <exact input/action> — got <X>, spec requires <Y>
  ...

SUSPICIONS (unverified, needs a check):
  - <observation and the input that might trigger it>

SPEC GAPS (route to spec, not to the implementer):
  - <implemented behavior no clause covers, or clause the code reinterpreted>

VERDICT: BROKEN (n defects) | CONVERGED (no real defect found across all five lenses)
```

## Feeding findings back

- **DEFECTS** → the implementer subagent fixes; re-run this stage on the fixed code.
- **SUSPICIONS** → verify or drop before acting. Never fix a suspicion blind.
- **SPEC GAPS** → surface to the user / route to the spec. Do not let the implementer silently encode an answer.

Loop until VERDICT is CONVERGED.

## Red flags — you're doing confirmatory review again

- You wrote "looks good" anywhere.
- You only checked the clauses and scenarios the spec listed.
- You trusted the green suite as proof of correctness.
- You never constructed a single input designed to break the code.
- You reported a defect you didn't actually trace.

Any of these → you reverted to confirmation. Restart from the refute-by-default stance.

## Related skills

- `implementing-a-spec` — runs this as the third review stage after spec-compliance and code-quality. Noise-filtering — dropping nitpicks that don't generalize — is that skill's **signal-to-noise gate** in the code-quality stage, not your job here. The adversary does the opposite: report every defect you actually traced, however narrow.
- `test-driven-development` — the discipline whose tests this stage tries to defeat.
- `systematic-debugging` — once a defect is confirmed, used to find its root cause before the fix.
- `verification-before-completion` — the gate this stage feeds; a spec isn't done until the adversary converges.
