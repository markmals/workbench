# Commit Discipline

Commit often, atomically, and with messages a careful human would write. Commits are durable
review units, not an afterthought.

## Natural commit points

Commit when the working tree is one coherent, internally consistent unit:

- A failing test, its implementation, and its verification are complete.
- A self-contained refactor is complete and its checks pass.
- A proposal, guide, policy, decision, or configuration change is complete and verified.

Do not commit half-edited, incomplete, or red work. Finish the thought — or stash and pivot — then
commit.

## One logical change

One commit contains one logical change. If its description needs “and also,” split it. Keep
unrelated dependency updates, formatting sweeps, and cleanup in separate commits or drop them.

## Scoped Commits

This repository uses [Scoped Commits](https://scopedcommits.com/), not Conventional Commits. Every
ordinary subject is:

```text
<scope>: <imperative description>
```

Write an imperative, present-tense description: `add`, `fix`, `remove` — not `added` or `adds`.
Keep the subject under roughly 72 characters, specific, and without a trailing period. Use an
optional body for motivation or non-obvious trade-offs; wrap it at roughly 72 characters.

Do not write Conventional Commits `type(scope):` subjects. Scoped Commits lead with the area being
changed.

The allowed scopes are:

| Scope                                                 | Use for                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proposal` · `policy` · `decision`                    | The corresponding record type                                     |
| `guides` · `docs`                                     | Guides and rendered documentation                                 |
| `tools` · `ci` · `mise`                               | Tooling, workflows, and task definitions                          |
| `agents` · `skills` · `rules` · `templates` · `hooks` | Agent process infrastructure                                      |
| `readme` · `vision`                                   | Project overview and direction                                    |
| `treewide`                                            | A genuinely repository-wide change with no narrower home          |
| `<NNNN>-<slug>`                                       | Work implementing that real proposal, such as `0007-export-queue` |

An adopting project extends this vocabulary with product scopes in `.agents/commit-scopes`, one
scope per line. Prefer the narrowest scope that accurately describes the change; use `treewide`
only for a true sweep.

Examples:

- `proposal: clarify release preview ownership`
- `guides: explain the readiness report`
- `hooks: enforce scoped commit subjects`
- `0007-export-queue: reject duplicate export jobs`

Mechanical merge, revert, fixup, and squash commits are exempt. The `commit-msg` hook enforces
ordinary subjects and scopes.

## Staging

- Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Stage explicit paths only.
- Run `git status` before staging. Decide exactly what belongs in this commit.
- Run `git diff --staged` before committing. Unstage anything unexpected.
- Preserve the user's uncommitted changes. Do not discard, overwrite, stage, or reformat work you
  did not make.

## Commit hooks and history

- If a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did not happen. Fix the issue, re-stage, then create a
  new commit.
- Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify` unless the human explicitly asks.
- Default to a new commit. Amend only when the previous commit is local, the correction belongs to
  the same logical change, and amending makes history clearer.
- Never rewrite pushed history. Correct it with a new commit. A force-push is a history rewrite
  and requires explicit human confirmation.

## Never commit

- Secrets: environment files, credentials, tokens, and keys.
- Build output and generated artifacts the project does not track.
- Personal editor configuration unless the human explicitly asks.
- Large binaries unless the project explicitly tracks them.

If an unexpected secret appears in `git status`, stop and warn the human.

## Frequency

Prefer many small, focused commits to one large commit. Commit at each natural green boundary
before beginning the next independent change.

## Push policy

Pushing the feature branch to `origin` is expected and routine: it creates and updates the draft
pull request that serves as the durable workspace. Push early and push often.

Pushing directly to the default branch is prohibited. Work reaches the default branch only by
merging its pull request.

Force-pushing, deleting a branch, publishing a release, and merging require explicit human
confirmation. Merging happens in phase 5 after human acceptance, not because the agent judges the
work acceptable.
