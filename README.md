# Workbench

A personal CLI for managing my own projects. Most stuff is hard coded for myself. Feel free to fork and hard code for yourself instead or make it more generic or whatever. Run `wb -h` to learn more.

## Development

To get started:

```sh
mise install
mise run build
./bin/wb <command>
```

If you want to do some testing in a temporary directory, you can use the `mise run dev` command instead of building to `./bin`.
