# Homebrew Release

Publishes a new version to the Homebrew tap with pre-built bottles.

## Prerequisites

- Clean git working directory
- All tests passing
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated

## Release Steps

### 1. Determine version

Ask the user what version to release, or infer from context. Follow semver (vX.Y.Z).

### 2. Create GitHub release

Use `gh release create` which creates both the tag and release.

The `--generate-notes` flag auto-generates release notes from PR titles and commits since the last release.

For pre-1.0.0 versions, add `--prerelease` to mark as a prerelease:

```bash
# For v1.0.0+
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --generate-notes

# For v0.x.x (prerelease)
gh release create v0.X.Y --title "v0.X.Y" --generate-notes --prerelease
```

### 3. Get the SHA256

After the release is created, get the tarball checksum:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
```

### 4. Update the formula

Clone or navigate to the homebrew-tap and update the formula:

```bash
# Clone if needed
gh repo clone OWNER/homebrew-tap /tmp/homebrew-tap 2>/dev/null || true
cd /tmp/homebrew-tap
git checkout main && git pull

# Create branch
git checkout -b bump-vX.Y.Z
```

Edit `Formula/{{ lower .Name }}.rb`:
- Update `url` to use new version tag
- Update `sha256` with new checksum

### 5. Create PR for bottle builds

**Important**: The PR must contain actual formula changes (version, sha256, etc.) for `brew test-bot` to build bottles. Empty commits or PRs without formula changes will not trigger bottle builds.

```bash
git add Formula/{{ lower .Name }}.rb
git commit -m "{{ lower .Name }} vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin bump-vX.Y.Z
gh pr create --title "{{ lower .Name }} vX.Y.Z" --body "Version bump with bottle builds"
```

### 6. Inform user about next steps

Tell the user:
- PR created at the returned URL
- CI will build bottles for configured platforms
- Once CI passes, add the `pr-pull` label to merge:
  ```bash
  gh pr edit <PR#> --repo OWNER/homebrew-tap --add-label pr-pull
  ```

## Formula Conventions

- Description must not start with an article ("A", "An", "The")
- SHA256 must be lowercase, 64 characters
- Use env vars in workflows to avoid script injection
